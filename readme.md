# 🦋 TO-DO CLI APP

⚡ Start your Node.js project with Typescript using Test Driven Development (TDD) practices.

### 📋 GitHub Actions Workflow:

[![🏠 Build](https://github.com/ITAcademy-DevTeams/todo-api/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ITAcademy-DevTeams/todo-api/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and tests the application when code changes are pushed to the master branch or a pull request targeting the main branch is opened or synchronized.

### 📥 Installation

To get started with this template, you first need to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ITAcademy-DevTeams/todo-api.git
```

Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 🏁 How To Start

To start the server in development mode, run the following script:
```bash
npm run dev
```


### 🚀 Production

To run the server in production mode, first build the TypeScript code into JavaScript by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the dist directory with the compiled JavaScript files.

Then, start the server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server and make it available.


### 🏗️ Scripts
This project comes with several predefined scripts in the package.json file:

```test```: Runs tests using Jest.

```lint```: Runs ESLint to check code quality.

```lint:fix```: Runs ESLint to fix code style issues.
